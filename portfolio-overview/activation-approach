# Activation Approach (Snowflake ASE)

My goal as a Solution Engineer is to reduce time-to-value
while setting customers up for long-term success.

I optimize for progress, not perfection.

---

## Phase 1 — First Workload
Objective: Deliver a successful query as quickly as possible.

- Start with the simplest ingestion method that works
- Avoid premature automation
- Use secure, cloud-native access patterns
- Validate success with business-relevant queries

Outcome:
- Customer confidence
- Clear proof of Snowflake value

---

## Phase 2 — Automation
Objective: Reduce manual effort once ingestion becomes recurring.

- Introduce Snowpipe only when justified
- Use event-driven ingestion
- Keep costs predictable and visible

Outcome:
- Scalable ingestion
- Low operational overhead

---

## Phase 3 — Enablement
Objective: Leave the customer self-sufficient.

- Document architecture and decisions
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Explain tradeoffs clearly

Activation is successful when the customer no longer depends on me.
